# MemoryLens

## Overview
MemoryLens is a mobile application created to support individuals affected by memory loss. Using advanced facial and object recognition technology, the app helps users identify and remember important people and items in their daily lives. Users can store images of family members, friends, and familiar objects in the app's database. When the device's camera is pointed at someone or something, MemoryLens instantly recognizes and provides information about the person or object. The app also features voice-to-text functionality, allowing users to interact through a conversational chat interface, making it easier to ask questions and receive information about their saved memories.
